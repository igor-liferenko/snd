Play via "aplay -D sysdefault:CARD=DEMO test.wav" (test.wav is my.pcm from pcm/)
and in each function output byte to UART and which byte will not appear, remove that function.
NOTE: compare with main speakers via "aplay -D sysdefault:CARD=Generic test.wav"

read libasound2-doc and do that pcm/ will work like alsa/ (reason why I want to do without alsa-lib: to be able to compile program out-of-tree for openwrt); another option is to use "aplay" on openwrt (but if TTY is needed, only dir320 must be used because cdc-acm driver is patched there, and on dir320 there may be insufficient space for "aplay")

ensure via wireshark that pcm file is transmitted as-is in pcm/

When you will merge this with avrtel/, pay attention to this:

One major issue with CDC-ACM is that it requires two Interface descriptors,
which will upset most hosts when part of a multi-function "Composite" USB
device. This is because each interface will be loaded into a separate driver
instance, causing the two interfaces be become unlinked. To prevent this, you
should use the "Interface Association Descriptor" addendum to the USB 2.0 standard
which is available on most OSes when creating Composite devices.

??? But what about "Union functional descriptor"? + see usb/arduino-combined.pcapng
