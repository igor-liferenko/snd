Play via "aplay -D sysdefault:CARD=DEMO test.wav"
and in each function output byte to UART and which byte will not appear, remove that function.
(this works: aplay -D sysdefault:CARD=Generic test.wav, disable pulseaudio as said in "Dynamically enable/disable" at https://wiki.debian.org/PulseAudio if not)
NOTE: test.wav is my.pcm from pcm/

read libasound2-doc and do that pcm/ will work like alsa/

ensure via wireshark that file is transmitted as-is

use '@i OUT-endpoint-management.w' in this program

When you will merge this with avrtel/, pay attention to this:

One major issue with CDC-ACM is that it requires two Interface descriptors,
which will upset most hosts when part of a multi-function "Composite" USB
device. This is because each interface will be loaded into a separate driver
instance, causing the two interfaces be become unlinked. To prevent this, you
should use the "Interface Association Descriptor" addendum to the USB 2.0 standard
which is available on most OSes when creating Composite devices.
