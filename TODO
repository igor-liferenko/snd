Play via "aplay -D sysdefault:CARD=DEMO test.wav"
and in each function output byte to UART and which byte will not appear, remove that function.
(this works: aplay -D sysdefault:CARD=Generic test.wav, disable pulseaudio as said in "Dynamically enable/disable" at https://wiki.debian.org/PulseAudio if not)

ensure via wireshark that file is transmitted as-is

use '@i OUT-endpoint-management.w' in this program
