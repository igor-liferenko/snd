remove all what is in demo.ch and not in capture.pcapng
http://microsin.net/programming/avr-working-with-usb/avr298-usb-audio-demonstration.html
HINT: compile Atmel's audio demo and see wireshark trace what is used and take only that
+ use pcm/ and ensure via wireshark that file is transmitted as-is
and use '@i OUT-endpoint-management.w' in this program

The plan is this:
First make it play in audacity (see via cat /proc/asound/card1/pcm*p/sub*/hw_params when it will be playing), then in each function output byte to UART and which byte will not
appear, remove that function.

HINT: trace ordinary sound card and compare
